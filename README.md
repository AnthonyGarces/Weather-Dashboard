The goal of this project is to incorporate the OpenWeatherMap api to make a site that'll tell me the weather conditions in any city in the world. 
There should be a field where the user can input a city name that'll run the search, then it should log the city below so that the user can see all of their past searches. 
    Clicking that city name should update the weather on the page
After the city is selected it should display the City, the date, the current temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, the UV index, and an image that'll reflect the weather conditions
Separately it should give a 5 day weather forecast for the city, which includes the dates, icon images, the highs and lows of the temperature, and the avg humidity
